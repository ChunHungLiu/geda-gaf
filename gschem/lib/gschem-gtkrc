# This file is required so that font in the menus is fixed and NOT
# proportional.  I used fixed because it is the lowest common denominator
# of fonts and is almost guaranteed to be installed
#
# If you think that this font is too small, you can try fonts like:
#
#       10x20 12x24 12x24 5x7 5x8 6x10 6x12 6x13 6x13bold 6x9 7x13 7x13bold
#       7x14 7x14bold 8x13 8x13bold 8x16 9x15 9x15bold
# 
# or any other fixed width font.
#

style "defaultfont"
{
  font = "fixed"
