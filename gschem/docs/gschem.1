.SH NAME
gschem - gEDA/gaf Schematic Capture
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gschem
[\fIOPTION\fR ...] [\fIFILE\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B gschem
is a schematic capture application, and is part of the
gEDA (GPL Electronic Design Automation) toolset.  It is used to draw
electronic schematics, which describe the logical structure of an
circuit.  Schematics are made up of symbols, which represent the
various components in the circuit, and are obtained either from a
standard library or created by the user.  The connections between
components represented by nets (wires).  Schematics may be printed to
a PostScript file for printing or further conversion to other output
formats.  Output to various image formats is also supported.

.B gschem
can also be used for editing symbols for use in
schematics.

.SH OPTIONS

.B -q
Quiet mode. Turn off all warnings/notes/messages.
.TP 8
.B -v
Verbose mode.  Output all diagnostic information.
.TP 8
.B -r filename
Specify a rc filename.  Normally
.B gschem
searches for the system configuration file, then
`$HOME/.gEDA/gschemrc', and finally for a `gschemrc' file in the
current working directory.  This option allows the user to specify an
additional rc file which is read after all the other rc files have
been are read.
.TP 8
.B -s filename
Specify a Scheme script to be executed at startup.
.TP 8
.B -o filename
Specify a filename for PostScript output.  This command line argument

.B gschem
from a shell script and with a Scheme script.  The filename can be
changed through the print dialog box.
.TP 8
.B -p
Automatically place the window. This may be useful if running gschem
from the command line and generating output.
.TP 8
.B -h
Print a help message.
.TP 8
.B -V
Print
.B gschem
version information.

.SH SCHEMATIC AND SYMBOL FILES
Optionally, schematic or symbol filenames may be specified on the
command line.  Any schematic or symbols specified are loaded at
startup as separate documents in the schematic editor.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.B GEDADATA
specifies the search directory for Scheme and rc files.  The default
is `${prefix}/share/gEDA').
.TP 8
.B GEDADATARC
specifies the search directory for rc files.  The default is `$GEDADATA'.
