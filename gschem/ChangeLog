    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Implemented the ability to change the color of junctions (code for #1746675).
    
    The filled circles (at the junction of nets) and filled boxes (at the
    end of unconnected nets) were the same color and it was hard to tell the
    difference from a distance.  This patch addes (junction-color ...) rc
    keyword and allows the user to change the junction color.  The default
    color for the dark color scheme is yellow and the default color for the
    light color scheme is purple.

    libgeda: s_clib_toplevel_get_symbol_names() is poorly named.
    
    s_clib_toplevel_get_symbol_names() returns symbols, not names of
    symbols, so rename it to s_clib_toplevel_get_symbols().

    gschem: Add "In Use" view to component selector.
    
    The "In Use" view shows symbols which are instantiated in open
    schematics, for ease of adding more symbols similar to the ones
    already present.  This is particularly useful for frequently-used
    symbols such as resistors and capacitors.

    gschem: Add a "Refresh" button to component selector.
    
    In order to update the symbol library, a "Refresh" button is needed
    (because we don't do it automatically any more).

    gschem: Don't use generic response IDs for compselect actions.
    
    The component selector "OK" and "Apply" buttons aren't actually "OK"
    and "Apply" actions, so they shouldn't use those response IDs -- it's
    confusing.
    
    This patch adds special response IDs for these actions. This is a
    preparation for using "proper" Place and Hide icons & text.

    gschem: Fix a race condition with mouse wheel scroll events (1740327)
    
    If more than one mouse wheel scroll events are received into the event
    queue before the first one can be processed, then the program was
    zooming in to the wrong location.  This is because the mouse moved
    event handler, which is triggered by a call to warp the cursor in the
    scroll event handler, must run to update the mouse postion global
    variables that the scroll event handler needs.

    libgeda: Add fine-grained control over f_open() behaviour.
    
    Add a function f_open_flags() which takes an extra argument which is a
    set of flags controlling actions taking while opening a file. f_open()
    wraps this with a default set of flags.
    
    Coincidentally, this also leads to a trivial fix for the file open
    dialog backup-message bug.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level

    Don't cache symbol pointers in persistent structures.
    
    Several persistent structures, including TOPLEVEL and OBJECT, cache
    pointers to CLibSymbols.  This is bad, because it makes removing
    component sources or rescanning them likely to cause stale pointers
    around the place.
    
    With fast hashtable-cached searches in place, this is no longer
    necessary.  This patch ensures that only symbol names are stored
    persistently.
    
    This patch also enables descending into embedded symbols using a
    component library lookup on the embedded symbol's name.

    Add a new function which returns the first exact match for a given
    symbol name, printing log messages if either there are more than one

    s_clib_symbol_get_data_by_name() to use new function and remove
    o_complex_add_by_name() as more or less redundant.

    Replace s_clib_glob() with s_clib_search(), which can operate in
    either exact matching or glob matching mode.  Use a hashtable to cache

    it is invalidated (for instance if a component source is added or
    removed, or the component sources are rescanned).

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    the placing of components, but gschem would still be in the add component
    mode (and clicks would still place components).

    Use "=" instead of "==" as an operator for test as the former
    is portable and the latter is a bash-ism

    Applied patch by Ivan Stankovic making dialogs within gschem save
    their position and size on exit and restore it on opening.
    Geometry is saved to {$HOME}/.gEDA/gschem-dialog-geometry
    
    Dialogs inherit this functionality by using, or deriving from the
    new GschemDialog class (A GtkDialog subclass).

    Implement new component library system in gschem.
    
    A new component library model was introduced into libgeda to
    allow gschem etc. to work well with database systems.  This
    patch updates gschem to use the new library system.  Most code
    dealing with creating, updating and (un)embedding symbols is
    affected.  However, this patch should not introduce any
    changes for the end-user.
