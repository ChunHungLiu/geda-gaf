	   - Enough RAM for X (usually 16 Mbytes but 32 Mbytes recommended)

	Running UNIX:
	   - Semi recent version of UNIX
	   - Compiled on:
		FreeBSD (2.2.5) 	
		Linux (2.0, 2.2)	(and highly tested) 
		Solaris (2.5)		
		SunOS (4.1.3)	
		HP-UX (9.07)	

	The X window system 	
		- A resolution of at least 800x600
		- A color display
		- 3 button mouse (2 button works, but 3 button is better)

	A C compiler (that understands ANSI, like gcc) 

	GLIB version 2.2.x or later (and anything glib requires)
	GLIB version 1.2.x is no longer supported. 
	Glib can be found at ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk

	GTK+ version 2.2.x or later (and anything gtk requires)
	GTK+ version 1.2.x is no longer supported. 
	Gtk can be found at: ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk

	libgeda (same version as gschem)
	This can be found on the gEDA website/ftpsite

	symbols (same version as gschem)
	This can be found on the gEDA website/ftpsite
		
	GUILE - guile-1.6.x or later is required (and anything guile
	requires).  Guile 1.4.x is no longer supported.
	Guile can be found at: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/guile

	for LibStroke is: http://www.etla.net/libstroke/

	libgdgeda 2.0.15 [OPTIONAL] - if you want the ability to write png
	images.  New versions of libgeda/gschem write png using internal code,
        so you will still be able to create png images without using libgdgeda.
	libgdgeda is based on gd 2.0.15  The homepage for gd 2.0.x is
	http://www.boutell.com/gd  You can find libgdgeda on the gEDA
	website: http://www.geda.seul.org/dist

        If you use libgdgeda then you also need zlib.  zlib can be found at:
        http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib  zlib can also be found on
        the gEDA website: http://www.geda.seul.org/dist

        If you use libgdgeda then you also need libpng.  libpng can be found 
        at: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngcode.html  libpng can also be              found on the gEDA website: http://www.geda.seul.org/dist

- Notes
 
	* For anybody developing guile scripts using guile 1.6.x really should
	  set GUILE_WARN_DEPRECATED=detailed   to see if they are using any
	  deprecated guile functions in their scripts.  gschem disables the
	  guile deprecated function warnings by default.
