TODOs
----------------------


Code cleanups (no particular order):
----------------------

	All of it. :-)

	Including all code cleanups listed in ../gschem/TODO

	Use the ascii code in all the font width specifiers (lib/sym/font)

----------------------



Feature additions (no particular order):
----------------------

	Added ability to rotate embedded complexes

	Added text with bars (inverted labels)

	Add support for subscripted text
	
	Figure out how to rotate and mirror text in place. (for doing mirrors
	on 90/270 to unmirrored 90/270 (and vs) correctly) (currently kludged)

	Change the way invisible text items are added.  Don't create the string
	if the text item is invisible.  Also don't do any other ops if that's
	the case

	Does it make sense to have attribute promotion with embedded 
	components
