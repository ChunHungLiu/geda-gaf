	* configure.in: Updated version to 20021103 (an official version)

	* configure.in: Changed some of the AC_MSG_ERROR lines to just
	echos, this will allow me to distribute prebuilt docs and still
	use the configure mechanism

	* symbols/Makefile.am, attributes/Makefile.am: Attempted to get
	the dist target to include all the built documentation.

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Updates to get things working a little
	more smoothly

	* symbols/symbols.tex, 7400a.eps, 7400b.eps: Fixed example to 
	actually be a correct symbol (first version had a duplicate net=
	pin value for both power and gnd).  Pointed out by Werner Hoch
	
	* symbols/Makefile.am, attributes.am: Further refined clean rules

	* Makefile and friends: Added a bunch of subdirs with other docs

	* gschem/ and gnetlist/: Added directory and appropriate txt files

	* toplevel/ and toplevel/gedadocs.html: Created directory to hold
	the toplevel index html file.  gedadocs.html is an index of all
	documentation provided with gEDA/gaf

	for the docs directory
