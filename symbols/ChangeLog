9/17/99 Changed a few of the IEC417 symbols (again) to use color 15
	(lock) as the grey color: ac-ac.sym ac-dc.sym adc.sym dac.sym
	dc-ac.sym dc-dc.sym

9/17/99	Changed a few of the IEC417 symbols to use color 17 as the grey
	color: ac-ac.sym ac-dc.sym adc.sym dac.sym dc-ac.sym dc-dc.sym

9/16/99	Created a spice symbol library which hold some of the special
	spice symbols by Bas Gieltjes
		- Added spice to all the required configure/Makefiles 
		- Added spice dir to system-commonrc.in

9/15/99	Added pin#= attributes to all symbols in the io library

	Added device= attributes to all the symbols in the io library

9/13/99	Fixed all the misc power/gnd symbols to work with the new net= 
	gnetlist options
		- Removed all special attributes
		- Properly named pin# attributes
		- Added net=GND:1 to gnd-1.sym 
		- Did not add any net= attribs to any v* symbol
		- Made sure all the v*-1.sym are consistant

	Removed vdd-1.sym and renamed vdd-2.sym to be vdd-1.sym 
	(old vdd-1.sym was just a 180 degree rotation of vdd-2)
	All v symbols should be drawn with the label on top, and the 
	pin going down.  All gnd symbols should have the pin going up.

	Created misc/vee-1.sym

	Created symbol directory called titleblock.  Moved all the title block
	symbols into this new library.

	Added above to Makefile/configure and to the system-commonrc.in files

	Created symbol directory called io (input/output).  Moved all input
	and output type symbols into this new library.
	
	Added above to Makefile/configure and to the system-commonrc.in files

	Created +3.3V, +5V, -5V, +12V, -12V, 9V, -9V symbols which
	contain the net= attribute

	Removed all device= attributes from the power/gnd symbols

9/6/99	Start of getting symbols updated with the new colors scheme:
		- All locked components need to be color 15 (locked)
		- All text items need to be color 9
	
	Did all title blocks (updated locked color to 15)

	Fixed a few symbols (74194-1.sym and 74174-1.sym) which caused
	a core dump (now fixed) by having improper/incomplete attributes

	Removed 74174-1.sym since it is wrong (wrong number of pins)

	Did all symbols which had text (updated text color to 9)

8/27/99 Set the program version to 19990829 to force Ales to release

8/3/99	Added a whole bunch of verilog symbols by Mike Jarabek

7/5/99 	Removed numslots=1 from switch-dip[4|8]-1.sym (isn't needed)

7/4/99	Added update/new symbols for verilog netlist from Mike Jarabek

7/3/99	Went through all symbols and eliminated all zero length objects

6/27/99 Integrated more symbols from Arnim Littek

	Integrated more maxim symbols as well as updates from Salman 

6/25/99 Integrated changes to some of the analog symbols by Arno Peters

5/29/99 Changed all symbols so that the top level attributes are no longer
