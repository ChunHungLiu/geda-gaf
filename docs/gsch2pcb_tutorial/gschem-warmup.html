<hr width=100% size=2>
You need to become familiar with doing a few things in gschem, so
just run <b>gschem</b> and start playing around:
<p>
You get an initial blank page with a menus and a toolbar at the
top.  As you select operations from the menus, notice that there
are usually keyboard shortcuts which can alternatively be used to
access the menu functions.
<p>
When drawing a schematic, It's a good idea to always start
by setting some schematic boundaries to draw within, so we will do this by
adding a titleblock.  I find that using a B sized titleblock lets
my schematics print at a nice size on letter sized paper:
	<ul>
		<li>
		Bring up the <b>Select Component</b> window by 
		selecting from the menu <b>Add->Component</b> or hit keyboard
		shortcut <b>i</b>.
		Or you could click the add component icon on the toobar.
		</li>
		<li>In the <b>Libraries</b> list, select <b>titleblock</b>.</li>
		<li>Under the <b>Components</b> list, select <b>title-B.sym</b>.</li>
		<li>Move the mouse onto the gschem drawing area and place the
		titleblock symbol by clicking the left mouse button.<br>
		Then click the right mouse button to abort adding more
		titleblock symbols.
		<p>
	<table cellspacing=10 bgcolor=#909088>
	<tr>
		<td>

		border="0" align="top"> </center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
		</li>
		<p>
		<li>With the mouse in the gschem drawing area, hit the keys <b>ve</b>
		(or <b>View->Zoom Extents</b>) to zoom the view to the titleblock
		 symbol extents.
		</li>
		<li> Back in the select components window, (bring it up again if
		you closed it).  Select the <b>analog</b> Library and then
		select the Component <b>resistor-1.sym</b> and place a couple of
		resistors on the schematic with the left mouse button.  Notice
		that as you place each one it is a red color and that indicates
		it is selected.</li>
		<li>Zoom in and out with <b>z</b> and <b>SHIFT z</b>.  If you get lost,
		zoom back to extents with <b>ve</b>.</li>
		<li>Alternate left clicking on both resistors to select them,
		but notice that if you don't hit the resistor just right, the
		titleblock is selected instead.  We really don't want to ever
		select the titleblock again, so we can lock it to prevent
		its irritating selection:  click so the titleblock IS selected, then
		select <b>Edit->Lock</b>.  Now it's easier to select the
		resistors as we like.
		</li>
		<li>Move the resistors around with the middle mouse button</li>
		<li>Select a resistor and then rotate with the <b>er</b> keys
			or the <b>Edit->Rotate 90 Mode</b>
		<li>Move the resistors relatively close together and then zoom
			in on them.</li>
		<li>Place the mouse on one of the resistor pins and hit the
			<b>n</b> key to start adding a net.  Move the mouse to
			a pin on the other resistor and left click to attach
			the net to the pin.  Right click to abort adding this net
			but notice that if you left click again you will start adding
			another net.

			Look at the toolbar and see that your mode has
			switched to adding nets.  Before you can change resistor
			selections again, you  will have to re-enter select mode
			with the <b>s</b> key or by clicking the select toolbar icon
			or by using the <b>Edit</b> menu.  But if you try to move
			a resistor with the middle mouse button, you can do it and
			you will automatically re-enter select mode.  You will
			have to play with doing things to get used to the gschem modes.
		</li>
		<li>If when you added the net between the resistors you get
			something that looks like this:
			<center>
		<img src="images/warmup-2.png" alt="images/warmup-2.png"
			border="0" align="top"> </center>
			It means you missed the pin on the right resistor.  Look
			closely and you'll see the tip of the pin is red and you
			must start and stop nets with the mouse on this red spot
			to make a connection to the pin.
		</li>
		<li>Select the net between the resistors and delete it with
			the <b>Delete</b> key.</li>
		<li>Select a resistor and hit the <b>ee</b> keys.  This will
			pop up the attribute editing window for the resistor.
			Here you can change existing attribute values or add
			new attributes with values to the resistor.  Practice
			well with adding attributes and changing attribute values
			because you will need to be very familiar with managing
			attributes when using gschem.</li>
	</ul>

	Now go back to the tutorial and try working through the simple
	example there.  If you encounter steps that aren't clear, look
	through
	the <b>gschem user documentation</b> and attributes documentation
	on the
	<a href="http://www.geda.seul.org/docs/index.html"
			name="gEDA Documentation"> gEDA Documentation </a> page.
