=== 0.2 ===

Released january 13, 2003.

As version 0.1 has appeared to be totally not functional, this is a first
version that can be used be users. It has only basic functions to manage
projects, files and run tools. Commonly used actions are accessible from
the menu. 

Do not expect that everything will work good together. Major problems are
with:

* PCB - in RedHat distribution m4 is located not in /usr/local/bin what
  is default location used by PCB, gnetlisted schematics are not loaded
  by PCB. 
  
* gwave - can display only transient results.

* verilog - problems with simulation "multifile" modules.

etc.

=== 0.1 ===

First attempt.
