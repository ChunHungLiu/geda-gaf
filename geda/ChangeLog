        * configure.ac: Updated version to 20040111

2004-01-01 Ales Hvezda   <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* configure.ac: Added checks for time.h and nanosleep.  nanosleep
	is used in the sleep function below.

	* src/main.c: Added a sleep function inside the main loop to reduce
	the CPU load.  Without this sleep, the while loop keeps the cpu
	100% busy.  With the sleep, the geda process spends more time 
	sleeping, hence lower CPU load.  This sleep will only occur on 
	systems which support nanosleep.

=== 0.2 ===

Released january 13, 2003.

As version 0.1 has appeared to be totally not functional, this is a first
version that can be used be users. It has only basic functions to manage
projects, files and run tools. Commonly used actions are accessible from
the menu. 

Do not expect that everything will work good together. Major problems are
with:

* PCB - in RedHat distribution m4 is located not in /usr/local/bin what
  is default location used by PCB, gnetlisted schematics are not loaded
  by PCB. 
  
* gwave - can display only transient results.

* verilog - problems with simulation "multifile" modules.

etc.

=== 0.1 ===

First attempt.
