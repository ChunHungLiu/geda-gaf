How to submit patches
=====================

Please submit patches to the patch tracker on SourceForge.net:

  <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161080&atid=818428>

Once you've submitted your patches, you may wish to also e-mail the
`gEDA-user' mailing list to announce that you've done so and to ask
for feedback.

To make it easier for developers to promptly verify your patches and
integrate them, please try to follow the following guidelines:

  - If your patch is big, try to split it up into a series of small,
    logical steps, and use a separate patch for each.

  - Avoid unnecessary whitespace changes. Please do not add trailing
    whitespace.

  - Ensure that each of your patches applies cleanly against the
    `master' branch of the gaf main git repository.

  - Please format your patches with `git format-patch', and ensure
    that they contain good commit messages.  The commit messages
    should include:

      * A one-line summary of what the patch changes.

      * A detailed explanation of what the patch changes, the problem
        it solves, and why you chose that approach to solving the
        problem.  Sometimes, the change will be very self-explanatory.
        Sometimes, the commit message will be considerably longer than
        the patch itself.

      * If the patch is related to another ticket in the
        SourceForge.net tracker (i.e. a bug or feature request),
        include its tracker item number.

      * If your patch fixes a regression, and you know which commit
        introduced the regression, include the broken commit's ID.

  - Make sure it's clear whether, and in what ways, you've tested your
    patch.

  - If you add functions, or change function definitions, make sure
    that the doxygen comments are up-to-date.

Sometimes, you may submit a patch and not hear anything back for a
while.  This can be for a number of reasons, and it's only very rarely
that there's a great conspiracy of gEDA developers to obstruct your
changes from getting included.  It might even be that your patch has
been committed, but the developer who did so forgot to let you know!
If it's been more than a couple of weeks since you submitted a patch,
you should e-mail the `gEDA-user' mailing list with a reminder.

A final thought: to get your patches included, make it easy to accept
them!
