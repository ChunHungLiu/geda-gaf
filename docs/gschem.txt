1. Introduction

	This is a very basic and crude first attempt at getting some
real user docs written for gschem.  This document is hardly finished or
polished but is better than no docs at all (which was the case for the
longest time).  Please forgive the tone of this document.  I (Ales) am
writing this just to get something done.  I am by no means a technical
writer so I'm sure some of my sentences are truly awful.  As everybody
says, programmers should not write documentation for their programs
and this document is a perfect illustration of a programmer breaking
that rule.

	This document assumes you know understand basic schematic capture,
like you understand that a component represents something and that nets
and buses interconnect these components to form a schematic etc...  
Eventually this document will describe all this in more detail, but for 
now this document is will describe how schematic capture is accomplished
in the gEDA system.



2. Overview

	gschem is the schematic capture program in the gEDA tool suite.
It's sole purpose is facilitate the input of circuit schematics or block
diagrams graphically.  *add some more stuff here*


3. Running gschem

	Running gschem is straightforward once you have installed it
on your GNU/Linux or UNIX system.

	The first step is to build and install the gEDA tools.
This step is not covered in this document.  You can tell if you have
installed the tools correctly by running the following commands:

	libgeda-config --version
	gesym-config --version
	which gschem

	The first two should return the version of the installed tools
(libgeda and the symbol library) and the last command should return
the path to the gschem binary.  If these commands do not return the 
expected results, then most likely the gEDA tools are not installed 
properly.
	
	To run gschem type:

	gschem 

	at any shell prompt.

	To look at a schematic which came with gschem run:

	gschem schematic_name.sch

	For a listing of the various command line flags type:

	gschem -h

	For a detailed explanation of the command line flags look
at the gschem man page (man gschem).	



4. User interface

	There are several ways to interact with gschem.  gschem
requires a keyboard and mouse.  There are two ways to initiate an 
operation or command:

	Using the mouse to select the operation off a menu 
	
			-- or --

	Typing the keyboard hotkey(s).

	To make matters more confusing, selecting an operation off of the
menus behaves slightly differently than typing the hotkey.  Most of the
operations operate on the currently selected object(s).  The menu selected
operations usually require some more input (usually a mouse click) after 
they are picked off of the menu and the keyboard hotkey operations take
that required input as the current mouse position.  This saves an extra
click since you can position the mouse at the right place, type in the
hotkey, and the command then executes.  Note, you can change this so that
both menu and hotkey behavior is exactly the same.  See the section on
the resource file for more info on how to configure this.

5. Basic Operations

	There are five kinds of operations in gschem:

	a. File related (Open/Close/Save/Print etc...)
	b. Addition of objects (Add nets/lines/pins/components etc...)
	c. Manipulate objects (move/copy/delete/rotate/mirror etc...)
	d. View operations (Zoom/Pan/Redraw etc...)
	e. Option changing (text size/gridding/snap etc...)

	This section will describe each of these.

	The terms page and schematic both refer to the same thing (a
	collection of objects that are loaded and being displayed).
	A window is that big window in which schematics are displayed
	and manipulated.


	a. File related operations:

	New Window

		Open a new window.  Each window is separate from all
		other windows.

	New Page

		Open a new page.  Usually this page will be called
		untitled_N.sch, where N is an incrementing number.

	Open Page...

		Open an existing page.	This will pop up a dialog box.
		Please see the later section on how to use the more
		advance features of this dialog box.

	Close Page

		Close the currently displayed page.  This will prompt
		you to save if you modified the page.

	Save Page

		Save the page as long as the page has a titled name
		(ie not untitled_N.sch).  If the page is untitled,
		then a Save As...  dialog box will appear.

	Save Page as...


		Opens the Save As.. dialog box.  Clicking Save As will
		save the currently displayed schematic.  The displayed
		schematic will be called the new specified name.

	Save All

		Unconditionally saves all schematics loaded in memory.

	Print...

		Brings up the Print dialog box.  Please see the dialog
		box section for more info on this.

	Write PNG...
	
		Brings up the Write PNG dialog box.  Please see the
		dialog box section for more info on this.

	Close Window

		Closes the current window.  If there are any modified
		schematics, a "Are you sure" dialog box will appear.
		Clicking OK will cause all unsaved schematics to be lost.

	Quit gschem	

		Like Close window, but close all opened window.  A "Are
		you sure" dialog box will appear for each window which
		has unsaved schematics

	Page Manager

		Brings up a dialog box which lets you 

	Page Next
	Page Prev

		These two options allow you to move in between opened pages.

	Page Discard

		Closes the current schematic forcefully.  If the current
		schematic is NOT saved then the data is lost forever.
		You will NOT be prompted or warned if you have modified
		the current displayed schematic.  Use with caution.
		Useful if you want to unload a schematic quickly.


	b. Addition of objects:

	An object is any of the below listed primitives.	

	Add Component

		Opens up a dialog box which lets you place components from
		the component libraries.  

		To place a component do the following:

			Select a Component library (which btw is specified
			in the Resource files, see section below) from the
			left list	

			Select a Component from the right list.

			Move the mouse into the main drawing window (you
			should see an outline). 

			Press the first mouse button to place the component.

		If a component is already select, hitting apply and moving
		the mouse into the main window will allow you to place 
		that component again.  

		To cancel a component place press the last mouse button or
		the ESC key.

		Please see the dialog box section for detailed information
		on this dialog box.

	Add Net

		Draws a net segment.  If you select this off of the top
		menu bar then:

			1. Press the first mouse button to start the net.
			2. Press the first mouse button to end the net.
			3. Another net will start at the last endpoint.
			4. Press the first mouse button to end that net etc...

			Press the last mouse button or ESC to cancel
			any net in progress.

		If you started this using the menu hotkey then the net
		start immediately at the last mouse position and then
		it behave exactly as above (except for line #1).

		After drawing a net segment (or segments) and canceling
		the last net segment, you are automatically placed in 
		select mode.  You must pick add net again or type the
		hotkey to add more nets.

		You can hold down the control key to draw non-orthogonal
		nets.  Just keep in mind that you cannot connect anything
		to the middle of a non-orthogonal net.

		The boxes at the end of the nets are connectivity cues.
		Filled boxes signified a dangling net (not connected to
		anything).  Filled circles are midpoint connections/junctions.
		These cues are drawn automatically and are an indicator
		of electrical connectivity.  

		See the section on electrical connectivity below for more
		information.
		
	Add Bus

		Basically the same thing as nets, except that it draws 
		buses.  Buses are very new and there are many aspects which
		are not defined yet, so keep that in mind as you uses buses.
		*More to be added here eventually*

	Add Attribute...

		Brings up the add attribute dialog box.  This dialog
		box is ONLY used to add attributes.  It does not display
		or manipulate already placed attributes.

		An attribute is nothing more than a text item which is
		in the form name=value.  It can be either unattached or
		attached.	

		To add an unattached attribute do the following:

			1a. Select an attribute name off of the top list
					-- or --
			1b. Type in the attribute name into the name entry
			2. Type in a value for the attribute.
			3. Pick any of the attribute options.
			4. Click Apply and move the mouse into the main
		           window (an outline of the text should be seen)
			5. Press the first mouse button to place the 
			   attribute.  The text will be red which signifies
			   an unattached attribute

		If you want to attach an attribute to an object then
		select the desired object first and then press the
		add attribute apply button.  The text should be yellow
		which signifies an attached attribute.	If you click on
		an object which has attached attributes, the attached
		attributes should be selected as well.

		You cannot place an incomplete attribute (an attribute without
	   	a name and value).

		To cancel an attribute place press the last mouse button or
		the ESC key.

		Please see the section on attributes below for more info
		on how to use attributes and more details.

	Add Text

		Opens up the text add dialog box.  

		To place text: 

			1. Type in text in entry field
			2. Hit enter or click Apply
			3. Move the mouse into the main window (an outline of
		 	   the text should appear and follow the mouse)
			4. Press the first mouse button to place the text

		If you leave the text add dialog box open you can place
		the same text item again and again by just clicking apply
		(or pressing enter) and moving the mouse into the main
		window.

		Text which is placed will be automatically capitalized.  
		Please see the Resource file section below on how to control
		this behavior.

		To cancel a text place press the last mouse button or
		the ESC key.

	Add Line

		Draws a line in the same fashion as drawing nets with the
		following exceptions:

			- A line has no electrical significance
			- Only a single line is drawn 
			- You keep drawing lines as long as you are in 
			  line drawing mode.

		To cancel a line rubberband in progress press the last mouse
		button or the ESC key.
	
	Add Circle

		To draw a circle (picking Add Circle off of a menu):

			1. Pick the center of the circle with the first button
			2. Move the mouse to see an outline of the circle
			3. Press the first mouse button to finalize the circle

		To draw a circle (typing the hotkey), same as above except
		that the center of the circle is picked for you at the last
		mouse position when you type the hotkey.

		To cancel a circle rubberband in progress press the last mouse
		button or the ESC key.

	Add Arc

		To draw an arc (picking Add Arc off of a menu):

			1. Pick the center of the arc with first mouse button	
			2. Move the mouse and pick the next point.  The
			   rubberbanded line represents the radius
			3. A dialog box will appear: specify the start angle
			   (in degrees) and specify the degrees of sweep.
			4. Press OK to finalize the values.

		The start angle can be positive or negative.  The degrees
		are specified using the standard cartesian coordinate
		system.  The degrees of sweep can be positive or negative.

		To cancel an arc in progress (while rubberband the radius)
		press the last mouse button or the ESC key or press the
		Cancel button in the arc dialog box.

	Add Pin

		Draws a pin in the same fashion as drawing nets with the
		following exception:

			- You keep drawing pins as long as you are in 
			  pins drawing mode.

		To cancel a pin rubberband in progress press the last mouse
		button or the ESC key.


	c. Manipulate objects:

	Most of these operations are modes which operate on the current
	selected objects.  Before you can execute the desired function
	you must select the objects you want to rotate.

	Select Mode

		Select mode is initial mode gschem starts out in.

		In select mode you can select objects.  

		You can pick single objects by clicking on them.  If an object
		is already selected than clicking on that object will keep
		it selected.  If multiple objects overlap then clicking in 
		one spot will cycle through the objects.  

		If you hold down the SHIFT key and click you can select
		and deselect multiple objects.	Doing this with multiple
		overlapping objects will cause the selection to cycle
		among the possible object selections.

		If you hold down the CONTROL key and click you will toggle
		the object in and out of the current selection list.

		To select multiple objects press and hold the first
		mouse button and drag the mouse till a selection
		box appears.  Drag the mouse (selection box) till it
		encompasses the objects you want to select completely
		and release the first mouse button.  The objects must be
		completely encompassed.  Using the selection box takes
		some practice.	If any previous objects were selected,
		they will be unselected.

		If you hold down the SHIFT key while drawing a selection
		box then you will add to the currently selected
		objects.  Objects cannot be removed using the selection 
		box and holding down the SHIFT key.

		If you hold down the CONTROL key while drawing a selection
		box then you will toggle any encompassed objects.
		If an object was selected then it will be unselected
		and vice versa.

		The selection mechanisms are not obvious and do require
		some practice.  There are some quirks so please report them
		as you come across them. 

	Edit...

		Allows you to edit text items (both content and text size).

			1. Select the text item to edit.
			2. Pick or type the hotkeys for Edit/Edit...
			3. Make the appropriate change and press OK

		Note, only the first text item will be edited; bulk text
		editing is not supported (yet).

	Copy Mode

		This mode allows you to copy the currently selected objects.

		To copy objects (picking Edit/Copy Mode off of a menu):

			1. Select the desired object(s)
			2. Pick Edit/Copy Mode off of a menu
			3. Pick an origin point for the copy (first button)
			4. Pick the destination point (first button)

		To copy objects using the hotkey for copy mode is almost
		the same as above except that the origin point is selected
		automatically for you once you hit the copy mode hotkey.

		After finishing the copy, you are automatically put back
		into to select mode.

	Move Mode

		Move mode is just like copy (above) except that instead
		of copying you are actually moving the objects around.

	Delete

		Delete allows you to remove objects off of the page.
	
		To delete objects:

			1. Pick the desired object(s).
			2. Select or type the hotkey for Edit/Delete
			3. Objects will be deleted immediately	

		Use this with caution since there is no UNDO yet!	

	Rotate 90 Mode

		Rotate mode allows you to rotate objects 90 degrees around
		a pivot/center point.

		To rotate objects (picking Edit/Rotate 90 Mode off of a menu):

			1. Pick the desired object(s).
			2. Select Edit/Rotate 90 Mode off of a menu
			3. Pick the pivot or center point of the rotate

		Rotating objects using the hotkey is similar to above except
		that the center point is the last mouse position at which
		you typed the hotkey.
		
		The objects will be rotate 90 counter clockwise.  You
		can keep rotate objects 90 degrees till you have them in
		the wanted rotation.  Text will always appear upright.

	Mirror Mode

		Mirror mode allows you to mirror objects horizontally
		around pivot.

		To rotate objects (picking Edit/Rotate 90 Mode off of a menu):

			1. Pick the desired object(s).
			2. Select Edit/Mirror Mode off of a menu
			3. Pick the pivot point of the mirror
	
		Mirroring objects using the hotkey is similar to above except
		that the pivot point is the last mouse position at which you
		typed the hotkey. 

		Objects are mirrored horizontally about the pivot point.
		If you want to get a vertical mirror then rotate and mirror
		the object(s) till you get the desired position.

	Stretch

		Stretch allows you to change the end points of nets.

		To stretch a net (picking Edit/Stretch off of a menu):

			1. Pick the desired net.
			2. Select Edit/Stretch Mode off of a menu
			3. Click the first mouse button near the endpoint 
	                   you want to stretch
			4. Move the mouse and the rubberbanding net to
			   the new location and press the first mouse button
			   to finalize the stretch.

		Stretching nets using the hotkey is similar to above
		except that the endpoint is automatically picked based
		on the last mouse position when you typed the hotkey.

		Right now you can only stretch nets, but this will be
		expanded to other objects eventually.  You can only stretch
		one net at a time.

	Slot...

		Slot... allows you to change the slot of a multiple slot
		component.  The component must support slotting (see the
		Components/Symbols section for more info on this).

		To change the slot:

			1. Select the desired component.
			2. Pick or type the hotkey for Edit/Slot...
			3. Type in the new slot number 
			4. Press OK.
			
		Slotting is still in development so expect some quirks.
	
	Color...

		This option allows you to change the color of any selected
		object (with the exception of components).

		To change the color of the currently selected objects:

			1. Select the desired object(s).
			2. Pick or type the hotkey for Edit/Color...
			3. A dialog box with a drop down menu will appear.
			4. Pick the new color 
			5. Press Apply.

		The color change will only take effect once you press Apply.
		The dialog box will not change to the color of the current
		object(s) (ie it only lets you change the color and not get
		the current color of selected object(s)).  

		You can leave this dialog box up and select new objects and
		change their color by pressing Apply.

	Lock
	Unlock

		Lock and unlock allow you to lock/unlock components in a 
		schematic.  Locking means that a component cannot be selected
		by a single click.  This is useful for title blocks and
		other components which should not be selectable because you
		might have other objects inside its boundaries and clicking
		inside the component (titleblock) would be a distraction.

		To lock/unlock components:

			1. Select the desired object(s)
			2. Pick or type the hot key for lock/unlock 
			
		The components will not be selectable with a single click.
		To select a locked component, use a selection box to select
		it.  This is the only way to select a locked component.

		You can lock and unlock regular objects (lines/pins/boxes...)
		which is nice when you are drawing something and an object
		is in the way continuously.  Just lock it and you will not 
		have to think about it when you click to select other objects.
		However, locking an object is not preserved in the file so
		once you quit any locked objects (lines/pins/boxes...) will 
		become unlocked.  The locked/unlocked state of components
		is preserved in the files though.
		
	Symbol Translate...

		Symbol translate is used to take whatever is drawn and
		translate it around using a inputed value (in mils).
		This operation is mainly used to translate symbols around
		(mainly to the origin).

		To translate a symbol, just select or type the hotkey for
		Edit/Symbol Translate... and a dialog box will appear.
		Enter the amount you want translate (positive or negative)
		in the X and Y directions (the same value will be applied
		to both directions).  

		If you enter a 0, then all the objects will be translated
		to the origin.  If you are drawing a symbol, zoom in a bit
		and then execute this (0 for the amount), since there are
		still some bugs in this operation.  It is a requirement
		that snap be on and that the grid snap spacing is set
		100 mils when creating symbols.
