Font definitions for gEDA (from XCircuit)
-----------------------------------------

These font/char definitions were originally done by Tim Edwards (Author
of xcircuit).  He has graciously allowed me (Ales Hvezda) to use these
in gEDA.  Without these font defs, I would never have had time to work
on other code.  Thanks again Tim!

Basically I took the XPoint values from alpha.h and turned each character
into a schematic file which is read by gschem (or whoever).  gschem (or
whoever) loads the individual characters as needed (and only once, it
caches them for future use).

So, *please* if you wish to use them, please ask Tim for his permission.
Again, the sharing of ideas (and font definitions) allowed me to work
on other things instead of reinventing these character definitions.
