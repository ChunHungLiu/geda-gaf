    This affords quite a lot of code clean-up, since we no longer have to
    maintain two versions of each operation which works on lists.

    Adjust MINGW32 specific CFLAGS from the suite
    
    Console applications should not build with the -mwindows flag, otherwise
    output reach the console. Conversely, we should build the GUI apps, gschem
    and gattrib with -mwindows so they don't bring up a console window when
    running.

    Remove some old comments better explained in commit history
    
    Comments annotated with a dates and developers initials clutter the
    code with historical details people may be reluctant to remove. Not
    all of these are still relevant, and those which are should probably
    could be kept in such a way as not to suggest code ownership. The
    commit revision log is a better place for determining authorship.
    
    Fix some whitespace in surrounding areas where I couldn't resist.

    Fix some gxyrs build problems with 'make distcheck'.
    
    'make distcheck' put the executables in a different tree than sources.
    Therefore, this script has to look in builddir directory for gxyrs
    script.
    
    As a bonus, gxyrs script location is now declared at the beginning
    of this script, and it checks if gxyrs script exists.

    Rename gxyrs golden files to comply with tar limit in filenames length.
    
    'tar' program limits all filenames length to be less than 99 characters.
    
    Renamed gxyrs golden files to comply with this requirement, and
    updated tests list and Makefile.am accordingly.

    utils: Fix gxyrs test-suite
    
    We built the path to the gxyrs script incorrectly when invoking from
    make check. Remove the "utils" subdir from that path, and ensure we
    set the right $top_srcdir path when invoking from the command line.

    gattrib, gschlas: Restore setting dummy select_func to ensure proper save
    
    The select_func function pointer (now owned and exported by libgeda) is
    assigned to OBJECT->sel_func for non-locked objects. Locking is achieved
    by setting OBJECT->sel_func to NULL, and when writing out objects, the
    locked flag is determined by comparing that that pointer to NULL.
    
    We need to keep providing a dummy function so we can differentiate
    between that and a NULL pointer. This was accidentally lost in
    commit 1aab94354f053887db67aa5702abc595795dfe82 which moved the
    select_func global variable into libgeda.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    utils: Adjust Makefile.am so we add $(AM_CFLAGS) to {appname}_CFLAGS
    
    This allows us to add CFLAGS to all targets from the AM_CFLAGS variable.
    
    Also export app-specific CFLAGS from configure.ac for gmk_sym,
    smash_megafile, convert_sym, sarlacc_schem and olib rather than
    copying those for gschlas inside Makefile.am. This keeps things
    cleaner should either set of CFLAGS need to change in the future.

    Use -Werror when building with gcc compilers. (More Makefile.am)
    
    Hopefully this will help to ensure compiler warnings get noticed
    and fixed by developers.
    
    Some Makefile.am with compiled sources were missed in the last
    (accidental) commit relating to these CFLAGS.

    Use pkg-config support for Guile if present.
    
    Using pkg-config allows easier cross-compilation, since the build
    process can use a pkg-config binary native to the build machine with .pc
    files for the host machine.

    Fix non-literal format strings which cause compiler warnings.
    
    We should be careful to avoid passing arbitrary strings into functions
    which take printf style arguments. In that case, always use the construct
    ("%s", string) rather than passing string as the format argument.
    
    Some cases were fixed by using g_strdup instead of g_strdup_printf(),
    some simply replace printf() for puts().

    Draw func cleanup.
    
    Rather than having libgeda require other applications to provide the
    *_draw_func symbols, libgeda should provide them itself. Other
    applications should then override them as required near their call to
    libgeda_init().

    tragesym: improved text alignment of top/bottom pin numbers. Version 0.0.14
    
    The origin of the top and bottom pin numbers and pin sequence did not have
    the same relativ position to the pin compared to the left and right pin.
    Fixed this relativ positions and the text alignments.
    This cosmetic issue was reported by Stefan Salewski. [1945153]

    tragesym: fixed version string handling
    
    With the commit 5a35c238f19622f8045784fa61497c80c4144fa6 a trailing " 1"
    was added to the version string. This is only correct if the source files
    do not contain that part of the version definition.
    Changed tragesym to accept both version strings "20060113 1" and
    "20060113" in the source file. Bug pointed out by Stefan Salewski.

    reenabled pintype translation.
    Improved some test files.

    Added the use of PCBDATA environment variable to make gsch2pcb relocatable
    
    Before this patch, m4_pcbdir was being set from the preprocessor variable
    PCBDATADIR which was set at ./configure time.  In order to be able to move
    gsch2pcb to a different install prefix, this path has to be changable at
    run-time.  If PCBDATA is not set, then PCBDATADIR is used (previous
    behavior).

    Add intltoolize to the build infrastructure
    
    Provide intltoolize infrastructure for translating .desktop and MIME
    XML files. Run gettextize after intltoolize if required, so that the
    infrastructure for providing libintl on a non GNU system still works.

    Print useful messages when f_open() fails.
    
    This reinstates error messages removed by the patch which modified
    f_open() to use GError for error reporting.

    Make libgeda's f_open() & f_open_flags use GError.
    
    This patch actually *removes* error message output from file loading
    errors is some cases.  This is for the sake of keeping the patch
    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.
