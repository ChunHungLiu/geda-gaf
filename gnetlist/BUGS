Bugs (no particular order): 
----------------------

	- If a component cannot be read, then this situation is not dealt 
	  with.  Technically at this point, gnetlist can't do anything so 
	  it really should exit.  Add code to do this later...

	- memory leaks (lots right now)

	- Ordering of pin outputs in spice netlist ouput for components like 
	  BJT transistors B C E.  This is wrong for now. (might be fixed now)

	- (SPICE backend) It is possible to have named a net something (say 1)
	  and then have an unnamed net called 1 as well.  Obviously my
	  unnamed net naming is lame.

	- gnetlist:get-toplevel-attribute only looks for the first occurrance
	  of the toplevel attribute.  Make this somehow better?

	

Finished stuff:

FIXED	embedded schematics don't netlist at all.

OKAY	infinite net connection loops

FIXED  	attach an label to a net which is going to no pin and it won't
        show up. (this is because mid point connections are not being
	dealt with properly...)
