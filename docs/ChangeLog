	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Updates to get things working a little
	more smoothly

	* symbols/symbols.tex, 7400a.eps, 7400b.eps: Fixed example to 
	actually be a correct symbol (first version had a duplicate net=
	pin value for both power and gnd).
	
	* symbols/Makefile.am, attributes.am: Further refined clean rules

        * configure.in and friends: Started using automake and autoconf
	for the docs directory
