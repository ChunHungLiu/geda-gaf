gschem AUTHORS

Ales V. Hvezda
E-mail: ahvezda@geda.seul.org
Web: http://www.geda.seul.org/

Kazu Hirata		- For doing significant code cleanup.  Greatly
			  appreciated! (especially since some of the code
			  is so gross)

Michael Linnemann	- For proposing the multi hot key scheme which is
			  currently in use

Stefan Petersen		- For writing the actual guile code which implements
			  the key remapping (worked almost out of the box!)
			- Pointed out some obsolete stuff in the configure.in
			- Bug fixes and improvements to gschem.scm
			- Continued bug fixes and additions to gschem.scm
			- list-keys.scm which prints out the keymap
			- For writing a better scheme like way of handling
			  strokes

Thien-Thi Nguyen 	- Wrote a much better g_read_file()
		     	- A configure.in which handles guile better then 
			  my quick hack
			- Help with the guile key remapping code 
			- Bug fixes and improvements to gschem.scm

Erick Britis Ortiz	- Provided a patch to fix the broken select box and  
Jeff McNeal		  box object

Jeff McNeal		- Provided a patch which adds the lowe level code to
	                  implement transparent zoom/pan when drawing 
			  nets/pins.

Manu Rouat		- For pointing out my inconsistant license headers
			  (which really need to be correct)
			- Found incorrect path in gschemrc.in 
			  (scheme-directory)
			- Contributed a patch to make zoom limits have a 
			  border (zoom limits looks much better now)
			- For contributing a patch which makes building
			  RPMs easier. (for libgeda/gschem/gnetlist/...)

Roger Williams 		- For supplying a patch with provides variable snap
			  grid spacing

			  For contributing the agile-vfo-block_1.sch schematic

			  For pointing out how to fix support for alphanumeric
			  slotting (in libgeda)

Mike Jarabek 		- For contributing code which displays grid points 
			  at negative coordinates. 
		
			  Providing an updated test_verilog.sym

Anatole Sokolov		- Pointed out a few bugs in o_erase_* (using a 
			  constant instead of a variable)

Egil Kvaleberg		- For providing a patch which gives gEDA gtk+ 1.1.x 
			  compatibility (integrated by AVH)

			  As well as a sample schematic (filter_1.sch)

Thomas Dean		- Submitting a few useful patches for various
			  things

Reinhard Kotucha        - For suggesting the use of setlinecap in the 
			  postscript output.  Output looks much better
			  with some sort of cap style set.

Matt Ettus		- For greatly rewritting the attribute edit
		  	  attribute dialog box

			  For writing the multi-add/edit attribute dialog box

Martin Benes            - For contributing the attribute promotion code and
                          a bunch of useful GUI bug fixes/patches.  Ales had
                          to slighly modify a few (to make them configurable)
