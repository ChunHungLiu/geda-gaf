    Remove linkage between OBJECTs and use GList for OBJECTs on the page
    
    This affords quite a lot of code clean-up, since we no longer have to
    maintain two versions of each operation which works on lists.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    Only an automake was left in this directory.

    Use -Werror when building with gcc compilers.
    
    Hopefully this will help to ensure compiler
    warnings get noticed and fixed by developers.

    gsymcheck: Don't export x_log_update_func, it is a libgeda symbol
    
    We set libgeda's exported x_log_update_func variable from
    gsymcheck.c. (This is declared as extern in libgeda's funcs.h)
    
    Move the logging function s_log_update() from globals.c (where
    it didn't belong) into its own file, s_log.c, making minor edits
    along the way. The log handler isn't called when "do_logging"
    is FALSE, so we don't need to test that from within the handler.

    Use pkg-config support for Guile if present.
    
    Using pkg-config allows easier cross-compilation, since the build
    process can use a pkg-config binary native to the build machine with .pc
    files for the host machine.

    Added the files of the "global" source tagging program
    and the logfiles of the gEDA programs to .gitignore.

    Remove default-series-name from all rc files
    
    Fixes brokenness leftover from previous removal of "series_name".

    Draw func cleanup.
    
    Rather than having libgeda require other applications to provide the
    *_draw_func symbols, libgeda should provide them itself. Other
    applications should then override them as required near their call to
    libgeda_init().

    Don't register recalc funcs as draw funcs.
    
    Some applications which don't draw schematics set the draw funcs to be
    the recalc funcs. This is silly.

    Remove unnecessary strippings of trailing directory separator.
    
    These strippings is no more necessary as GLib functions for building
    filenames (in particular g_build_filename()) takes care of any
    trailing directory separator for us.

Date:   Fri Jul 11 16:02:59 2008 +0200

    Simplify build of filenames with g_build_filename() (!).
    
    Modified code where possible to use preferably g_build_filename()
    instead of g_build_path(), or g_strconcat() and friends.

    Remove tests for NULL prior to freeing with g_free().
    
    Testing if pointer on memory to free is not NULL is unnecessary
    since g_free() does the test itself.

    gsymcheck: test for number in pinlabel and net attribute
    
    If a number is in a net attribute and a value of any pinlabel
    attribute then print a warning with some text. The previous patch
    removed the error message, this one adds warning. Whether this
    situation is an error or not depends on the users intention.

    gsymcheck: improved pinnumber check
    
    The changes will check for duplicate pins in net definitions.
    It also checks the net definitions and the pinlabel definition
    seperatly, thus a power pin can have a pinlabel and a net pin.

    gsymcheck: check for unknown attributes
    
    This test will check for all attributes that are not in a valid
    attributes list. A warning messages is printed. This will also catch
    old style attributes like slot#=# and pin#=#.
    And some often used attributes class, pins, footprint2.

    gsymcheck: moved obsolete and forbidden attribute checks
    
    This is a code cleanup patch, it moves the tests for obsolete and
    forbidden attributes to the symbol_structure test. Deleted the old
    check s_check_obsolete_forbidden_attributes() function and it's unused
    variables. In the output files, some format changes occured, but the
    meaning is still the same.

    gsymcheck: test for misplaced attributes
    
    The tests detect pin attributes are attached to nonpins or are
    detached. And attributes that are attached to any other objects.
    Attributes attached to pins that are not pin attributes

    added a check that contains all valid and five different case of
    invalid pintype values.
    Removed unused code in s_check_pintype() and added a function to
    check whether a string is in a list of strings.

    Removed misleading "pin count from footprint=" attribute check
    
    This check wasn't working correctly for all footprint= values.
    It probably worked fine for the DIP# and related footprints (ending
    with the number of pins in the footprin), but for others it was giving
    incorrect info/warnings.  This check will be replaced with something a
    little bit more flexible going forward in a later release.

    gsymcheck: added checks for offgrid pins
    
    The check prints an error message if the active end is offgrid and a
    warning message if the not active end is offgrid. The active end is
    detected with the whichend property.
    This fixes the feature request [#1565593]

    Make libgeda's f_open() & f_open_flags use GError.
    
    This patch actually *removes* error message output from file loading
    errors is some cases.  This is for the sake of keeping the patch
    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Alter guile 1.6 compat tests to work with older autoconf versions
    
    Don't use AC_DEFINE to define function like macros, instead use
    AC_CHECK_DECLS to set a HAVE_DECL_..., then use AH_VERBATIM to
    insert a test which defines a replacement if necessary.

    The update was done by running ./update-versions.sh 1.1.1 20070708 30:1
    at the toplevel.  libgeda's shared library version is now 30:1:0

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.
