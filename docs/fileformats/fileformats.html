File Formats in gEDA
</H1>
</CENTER>

This file is the official documentation for the file formats in gEDA.
The primary file format used in gEDA is the schematic/symbol format.
Files which end with .sch or .sym are schematics or symbol files. This
file format is current as of gEDA version 20001006.

<p>

All coords are in mils (1/1000 or an inch).   <br>
Origin is in lower left hand corner.<br>
Files should end in either .sch or .sym

Y increase going up.  Coordinate system is landscape and corresponds to a
sheet of paper turned on its side.

<UL>

	optional_flag = is only used in space char definition<p>

	This is a special tag and should ONLY show up in font definition 
	files.  The space character is special and is defined as follows:<p>

	F _ 11 1<p>


	The last one signifies that this definition is the space character.<p>

<H4> <LI> Attributes </LI> </H4>
<p>

Attributes are enclosed in { } and can only be text.  Attributes are text
items which take on the form name=value.  If it doesn't have name=value
it's not an attribute.  Attributes are attached to the previous object.
Here's an example:<p>

P 988 500 1300 500 1<br>
{<br>
T 1000 550 5 8 1 1 0<br>
pin3=3<br>
}<p>

        The object is a pin which has an attribute pin3=3 (name=value).
You can have multiple text objects (both the T ... and text string are
required) in between the { } <p>

	You can also have "toplevel" attributes.  These attributes are not
attached to any object, but instead are just text objects that take on the
form name=value.  These attributes are useful when you need to convey
some info about a schematic page and need the netlister to have access to 
this info.<p>


<H4> <LI> Embedded objects </LI> </H4>
<p>

	Embedded objects take on the following form:<p>

C 18600 21500 1 0 0 EMBEDDED555-1.sym<br>
[<br>
...<br>
... Embedded primitive objects<br>
...<br>
]<p>

Where the basename is EMBEDDEDcomponent_name.sym  In the example
above 555-1.sym is the basename.  The EMBEDDED tag and the [ ] are the
distinguishing characteristics of embedded components.  component_name.sym
must exist in one of the specified component-libraries if you want to
unembed a component.<p>


<H4> <LI> Extra info </LI> </H4>
<p>

Currently, nets and other components should NOT be inside components.<p>

gschem and friends do not like bad schematic/symbol files.  A lot of work
has gone into making gschem and friends read invalid files, but there are 
some cases were gschem may exit abruptly (core dump). <p>
