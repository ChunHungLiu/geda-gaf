	  as attributes as a sch/sym is being read in (o_read_attribs)

	* src/o_attrib.c: Fixed a nasty bug where the color of text was
	  being forced to the attribute color even if you didn't want that
	  color (pointed out by Magnus)

9/19/99 Make sure libgeda works with guile-1.3.2a

	Added some code to o_text.c to look for char_.sym for lowercase
	characters when running CYGWIN32

	Messed up above slightly, now fixed

	Did not return a success (zero) in s_color_request, now fixed

	Increased the number colors to 25

	Fixed all warnings

	Increased the .so version of libgeda to 4

9/18/99	Fixed a bug in s_color_gdcolor_init, had the gd color alloc in the
	wrong place (before a pointer was set)

9/17/99	Added/changed a few variables the various structures in struct.h

9/16/99	Removed the restriction that sym/sch files have to be perfect.  You
	now can have garbage in a sym/sch file and it won't exit, but instead
	warn the user and display what it read in.

	Added a bunch of tests into o_attrib_attach to prevent:
		- Attaching a non-text item as an attribute
		- Attaching an attribute to more than one object
	
	Improved the warning that is displayed when an attribute is already
	attached to an object

	Updated f_open and s_page_new to only open a schematic/symbol if it
	isn't opened already.

9/12/99	Added a flag in s_netlist structure for net naming priority

9/7/99	Added s_color.c 
	
	Cleaned up code to reflect the new function names created by s_color.c

	Removed all lame function pointers now that the color stuff is part
	of libgeda

	Added st_color structure to struct.h

	Added o_attrib_search_name_single_count which is like the other
	search_name functions in that it allows you to pick the n'th 
	occurance of an attribute but only searching the specified in object

9/6/99	Removed most color #defines from color.h, in prep for the new color
	system

	Temporarily broke color postscript printing
	Temporarily broke color image writing

	Put into colors.h the proper #defines for the new colors scheme
	
	Put a few user rc variables into the toplevel struct

	Fixed color postscript printing
	To do this, I had to create a ps_color_string global variable function
	pointer, so every gEDA program needs to define this if it has to be
	linked to libgeda

	Fixed a coredump bug which was caused by improper attributes (ie
	pin15=  (and no value))

	Fixed o_attrib_get_name_value so that improper attributes are NOT
	returned as proper attributes 

	Started to fix the broken color image writing
		- Re-arranged the allocation of colors in o_image.c

	Got color image writing working again

	Unfortunately had to create another function pointer for 
	x_color_gdcolor_init (ugg... I need to clean all this up...)

8/31/99 Renamed ntext to text (finally)

	Hopefully fixed the problem that gnetlist was having with embedded
	components ?

8/30/99	Fixed the bus visual cues postscript output to look better 
	(by controlling the capstyle)

	Fixed the direction of horizontal bus visual cues in postscript
	output

	Renamed all ales to conn and ALES to CONN


8/29/99	Added bus_gc

	Added support to the postscript / image printing for the bus cues

	Got bus to look thicker when they are imaged.  Still need to do
	the same to nets

	Fixed a postscript problem when you have thin nets enabled 
	(everything would be thick... which is the exact opposite of what
	 you would want)

	Removed a "this is totally broken" comment from o_complex_add_embedded
	(I think it works... but just in case...)

	Removed all warnings from the code

8/28/99 Fixed a minor bug: connect two nets to a bus to the same point, you
	would get an invalid cue, which isn't right (that's a valid bus
	midpoint connection).

8/27/99 Set the program version to 19990829 to force Ales to release
        on the 29th :)

	Updated all *.c and *.h files to have the right address for the
        FSF in the copyright/licence header
  
        Updated library so version 

8/18/99	More work getting buses to work correctly, updates to o_ales 
	(which will turn into o_conn eventually)

	Added #defines for output-capstyle
	
	Added code in f_print which does the work of the capstyle keyword 

	More work in o_ales to get bus to work right.
	
	Added code which determines if a connection is valid or invalid
		NOT valid:  pin to bus
		NOT valid:  net to endpoint of bus	
		
8/17/99 Started adding bus object
		Including creation of all basic functions
		Update toplevel structure (struct.h)
		Update of enumerated types of objects 

8/12/99	Added o_net_modify to support the stretch command

8/11/99 Added o_attrib_search_toplevel which searches for toplevel attributes
	in all loaded pages.

	Fixed a fatal bug (core dump) in the o_net_consolidate_lowlevel
	function (as well as a possible memory leak) that deal with
	connecting nets together which both had attributes.

	Fixed another memory leak in o_net_consolidate_*

	Fixed configure.in to properly check for cygwin port and X11
	libraries (for all other tools as well)

8/5/99  Added some stuff to configure.in for win32 builds

	Removed some bogus #includes <dirent.h> from a bunch of files
	s_attrib.c, s_papersize.c, s_stroke.c

	Renamed private POINT structure to sPOINT (single POINT) in m_basic.c
	(it was conflicting with some includes in win32)

	Added some more #if conditions to the #include <direct.h>, only
	include this on UNIX platforms

	Added code in configure.in to ignore the requirement for X11 for
	cygwin

8/3/99	Added to TOPLEVEL the net_consolidate flag

	Upgraded to libtool 1.3.3

	First attempt at getting net_consolidate to work with attached
	attributes

	Removed an extra return from o_attrib.c

	net-consolidate code is not 100% working today.

7/27/99 Added o_net_consolidate* functions which take net segments and 
	if possible combine the nets into one single net.

	Added o_net_consolidate to f_open so that it runs
	whenever you open a schematic

	Added o_net_consolidate to f_save so that it runs 
	whenever you save a schematic

7/25/99 Cleaned up g_read_file(). (by Kazu Hirata)
	
7/23/99 Added u_basic_strdup_multiple() to u_basic.c. (by Kazu Hirata)

7/21/99 More work on getting all objects to use new object init and link
	routines (rest of o_*_basic.c functions) 

	Created u_basic.c for utitlity functions to which Kazu is adding

	Removed all traces of s_passing.c and s_passing.h (Yeah, no more
	p_* kludge)

	#if 0'ed out add_object, replaced by new object init and link 
	routines

	Found all unknown p_* variables and removed them

7/16/99 Added s_basic_init_object which just creates an object and inits
	it with default values (this is part of the s_passing kludge removal)

	Added s_basic_link_object which links in the object into the passed in
	ptr linked list.

	Removed "int selected" from struct.h (was totally unused)

	Minor cosmetic changes in struct.h

	As a first test, converted o_ntext_basic.c to use new 
	s_basic_init_object and s_basic_link_object

7/15/99 Added support for libgdgeda 1.6 (mainly means searching for libpng)

	Removed all traces of old libgdgeda 1.5 gif support

	Changed the check for zlib (uncompress is the function it searches
	for)

7/10/99 Started to improve the performance of the math functions
	(was doing to much math everytime I was calling pix_x/pix_y)

	Finished speed improvements in mil_x and mil_y

	Updated a few places where it's important to call set_window
        (part of the math speed improvements)

	Added some variables to struct.h to support gschem rc files

	Added displayed_text_len which holds the true string length of 
	text which is displayed

	Added a check in o_ntext_read for unsupported text angles

7/6/99  Didn't really disable libgdgeda when using --disable-gdgeda
        Now fixed.

7/5/99	Fixed a minor typo when allocating a string "pin" instead of "slot"

	Hopefully got slotting to work with alphanumeric pins

	Removed all warnings	

	Updated configure.in a bit

	Updated version number (in all other programs as well)
	
	Updated README file (in all other programs as well)

7/4/99	Fixed the headers in all files to be correct (GPL)

7/3/99 	Removed some debug printfs from s_nethash.c

	Removed some obsolete data structure elements in the gnetlist part
	of struct.h

	Added code to warn user that a zero length object (line, net, pin 
	etc...) was just read in

7/2/99 	Fixed the ./configure stuff dealing with libgdgeda so that it works
	when libgdgeda isn't installed in a system directory

7/1/99 	Changed all gd includes to gdgeda to distinguish my version of gd
	from the official one

	Changed HAS_LIBGD to HAS_LIBGDGEDA

	Added #ifdef HAS_LIBGDGEDA where appropriate

	Missed a few spots in adding above, found them all I hope

6/29/99 Added s_nethash.c which deals with the nethash table in gnetlist

	Added init of the nethash table to s_page.c

6/26/99 Fixed the output of 180 rotated text in the postscript output

6/25/99 Added the ability to generate black and white gifs

	Moved a o_redraw_all from libgeda into gschem where it belongs
	(f_image.c)

	Removed all traces of GTK_DEVEL 

6/24/99 Got all the object primatives outputing to the image (including
	the rather painful arcs) 

	Added the ability to change the image size

	Added a o_recalc function which recalcs, but doesn't draw the objects

6/23/99 Added o_image.c (which is code which uses the gd lib to output 
	schematics to gifs)

	Added some entries in the TOPLEVEL structure to support the image
	printing

	Added f_print.c which includes all the toplevel code for writing
	an image

	Added support to configure and friends to make libgd an optional
	library

6/17/99 Added o_ales_search_object which goes through entire the ales_table and 
	finds the n'th occurance of object 

	Above may be removed and moved somewhere else (into gnetlist)

6/13/99 Removed s_delete_head from production

	Attempted to find the hidden attribute memory leak

	Found above memory leak and squashed. 

6/10/99 Added the start of support for not creating text items which are 
	hidden

6/9/99	Increased the number of symbols which can be in a directory to 1024
	from (256) in s_clib.c (s_clib_getfiles)

6/1/99	Fixed a few minor things in s_page.c and s_basic.c (p_circle stuff)

	Put some checks to prevent the coredump condition described below

	Put some casts to make make happy (less warnings)

5/31/99 Fixed printing for nets visual cues

	Removed all traces of the old connection system

	Discovered a core dump condition in clib_cache_free
	(caused by reading in swedish/non-standard-ascii character font
	 files, okay for now)

	Few minor touch up to s_clib.c, but not enough to solve above

5/29/99 Change the license for libgeda back to GPL (from LGPL)

	Put in another check in the o_ales_update_nets function to 
	make sure we don't add duplicate objects into the ales_list's

	Added in code which allows for unattached toplevel attributes
	(o_attrib.c)

5/99	See ChangeLog in gschem for all the changes related to the new
	connection stuff

	All connection stuff is in o_ales.c (will be renamed to o_conn.c
	once things get a big more stable)

5/16/99 Removed ../libgeda/prototype.h from f_print.c

        Removed ../include/x_states.h and ../include/x_events.c

        Moved prototype.h to ../include (change all the source as well)

        Commented out most of ../include/globals.h

5/13/99 Increased the size of buffers and the reading in of attributes 
	(o_attrib.c -- o_read_attribs)

	Increased the size of text strings (in o_ntext_basic.c)
	
	Fixed the appropriate string in s_passing.c (and s_passing.h)

	Fixed text_string allocation size in add_object (s_basic.c) 

	The above changes should fix the bug reported by Thomas Dean

4/27/99 Minor comment fix in include/struct.h

4/20/99 Minor fprintf warning/error message touchups in s_clib.c

4/15/99	Added coord dialog variables to WINDOW structure

3/23/99 Added GtkWidget *abwindow to struct.h

3/19/99	Added expand_env_variables which takes a string and expands all
	shell enviroment variables. 

	Fixed it so that when you do some attribute related activities
	the changed flag gets set

	Had to remove one of the above because just selecting something 
	with attributes would cause the flag to be set...

3/9/99  Remove all // from all include/*.h files

3/2/99	Added missing #include <stdarg.h> to s_basic.c

3/1/99	Fixed the vsnprintf problem I thought I fixed.  It's fixed now!

	Updated struct.h (new schcheck structure)

2/25/99 Added gsymcheck structures (include/struct.h)

2/12/99 Added code (#ifndef'ed) for vnsprintf to fix the Solaris 5.5.x 
	problem (didn't have vnsprintf).  The vnsprintf wrapper is from 
	Timidity++-1.2.1, which is under the GPL v2.0

	Minor bug fix to s_log_close (disable the logging of messages after
	you close the log file)

	Found a memory leak in s_clib_cache_free, the index used in the loop
        could wrap, so you might end up freeing only a portion of the entries

2/11/99	Searching through stroke structure fixed to be faster (does not 
	search the whole array of structures)

	Implemented a return value of s_stroke_search_execute (TRUE if it
	finds a stroke, FALSE otherwise)

	Increased max number of strokes to 256

2/9/99	Increased buffer which is used for reading in schematics to 1024
	characters

	Increased buffer which is used for saving schematics to 1024
	characters

	Added s_stroke.c (place where strokes to action mapping is stored)

1/24/99 Fixed a fprintf format statement (%% instead of %) in f_print.c

1/23/99 Fixed printing problem created when I switched the rc reading order

	Added code to support portrait printing printing (in struct.h : 
	print_orientation, defines.h - a few useful defines)

	Changed f_print_header, w_current is passed in now 

	Worked some on getting portait mode right (instead of the _hack_ 
	which it currently is)

	Changed the way the translating actual happens in the actual 
	postscript (instead of changing the points in C, it's done with a 
	translate), much cleaner. (be sure to remove all the dead code... 
	maybe?)

	Got portrait printing working more or less.  Still might be buggy
	though.

	Added support for color postscript printing (f_print_set_color)

	Fixed some bugs in the printing of colored nets (end/midpoints not 
	being colored right)

1/17/99 More gtk+ 1.1.x compatibility work (in s_log.c) (minor #ifndef)

	Changed s_log_message to use vsnprintf instead of the g_v* functions
	since they were not behaving like I want them to.

1/9/99	Added gtk+ 1.1.x compatibility to libgeda
		g_vprintf -> g_strdup_vprintf (s_log.c)

12/30/98 Removed duplicate code from snap_grid function

12/15/98 Added clip_nochange and clip_change (really just copied and
	 changed existing code).  These routines either just tell if a 
	 line (object) should be clipped and/or the actual points are 
	 clipped. 

	 Added SCREENencode_halfspace and WORLDencode_halfspace
	 which support above code

	 Discovered that my clipping routine wasn't working completely 
	 right (slope was always zero) fixed now? 

12/13/98 Fixed pin color being saved as -1
	 
	 Added some checks in clip to make sure you don't divide by zero 
	 Assume the object is visible if you were going to divide by zero.

12/9/98 Added WORLDabs and SCREENabs, these function, don't return a points
	coordinates, but rather an absolute measure in either world or screen
	coordinates (such as a width of a line or the radius of a circle)

	Finally fixed o_ntext_print so that you can print out ('s and )'s.
	(should work on all postscript printers correctly)

	Changed the ps of text output so that it uses "show" instead of
	"true charpath fill"

	Cleaned up rest of circlefixme comments left over from yesterday

12/8/98 Added st_circle structure and CIRCLE typedef to include/struct.h

	Started changing o_circle_basic to use new structures above

	Changed s_basic to allocate and free above structures

	Added circle structure to s_passing.c/s_passing.h
	
	Added some if's in add_object for p_line_points and p_circle

	Went through and added p_circle=NULL to all the places that needed it

	Went through and fixed up all prototype errors associated with above
	change

	Discovered a major bug in o_complex_rotate_lowlevel, was trying to
	rotate a circle using a box routine (worked previously since circle/box
	used similar datastructs, now that's changed) 

	Found the same sort of bug as above in o_complex_mirror_lowlevel. 
	(trying to use box routine to mirror a circle)

12/6/98 Found another really long term bug in dist() (wrong value being 
	set to temp var).  I don't know how it worked with this bug.

	Found another long standing bug in circle, again not sure how things
	worked before, dumb luck.  When saving, radius which was saved 
	could have been zero due to how the circle is represented in memory
	(stupidly)

12/5/98 Found a nasty bug in the printing of X endpoint lines, was using
	offset variable instead of cross, also had the wrong variables
	in various places

12/3/98	Added Tom Javen's finnish / swedish libgeda patch to o_ntext_basic.c

11/27/98 Apparently I didn't fix the %! in f_print.c so now it's definately
	 fixed 

11/18/98 Removed some irrelavent/dead/wasteful code from m_basic.c (math 
	 routines)

11/15/98 Added code to center LIMITS printed schematics

	 Added code to deal with space.sym (the right way) (when reading in
	 the width specifier)

	 Added backtick.sym to o_ntext_basic.c

11/6/98 Added sort routine to s_clib_getfiles (so that components are in 
	alphabetical order when displayed)

	Added support to TOPLEVEL struct for print dialog box

	Added s_papersizes.c, place to hold paper sizes read from rc file

	Added print_output_type to TOPLEVEL structure 

11/5/98	Added paper_width, paper_height to the TOPLEVEL structure

	Started work on generalizing the postscript printing (print to
	any papersize)

	Started work on being able to print out the current window

10/28/98 Cleaned up o_ntext_basic to get rid of special code for space 
	 character

10/25/98 Cleaned up all warnings (-Wall only)

	 Added some error checking in a few misc places

	 Added version information to o_save (o_save_write_header)

	 Added version information reading to o_read 
	
	 Passed version info to all o_*_read functions (this was done so, 
	 because o_read is called recursively)

10/24/98 Added the ability to have comments in schematic files, but they are
	 not saved...

10/22/98 Removed arc bounding code again... still not working right

	 Added o_attrib_slot_update (update pins based on slot, given complex)

	 Added o_attrib_search_slot_number (search for slot#)

	 Added o_attrib_search_pin_number (search for pin#)
	
	 Added o_attrib_slot_copy (copy pin information over to new complex)

	 Added the o_attrib_slot_copy to o_complex_copy

	 Found a memory leak in the above code, fixed (along with some other
	 major/minor bugs)

	 Got the first working version of the slotting done

10/18/98 Added o_attrib_search_slot 

	 Changed o_attrib_search_name_single to return the object where the
	 attribute lives

	 Added a bunch of o_attrib_search_name_* function to search for
	 various standard attributes

10/17/98 Applied patch by Roger to add variable grid spacing

10/15/98 Attempt to fix the arc bounding code (doesn't quite work 100%)

10/12/98 Found a small bug in world_get_circle_bounds which was causing 
	 a_zoom_limits to set the wrong value if a circle was the largest 
	 object 

	 Finally fixed o_arc_add so that it takes world coords like all
	 the other objects! Woo Hoo!

10/10/98 Added netlist structures to struct.h 

	 Added visited flag to object structure

10/9/98 Removed some really old #if 0 and did a small amount of code cleanup

10/8/98 Worked some more on the mirror code of complex objects

	Almost working except for text inside components which is unmirrored 
	(that displays incorrectly)

10/6/98 Broke schematic format again with the addition of the mirror flag
	on complex objects

	Added code to implement above

	Changed the way the rotating of complex is done

10/5/98 Added o_line_mirror

	Found a nasty cpu sucker, in o_ntext_rotate, where you were doing
	the rotate effectively twice.  Oops.  Removed one line rotate while
	loop

	Added rest of o_*_mirror

	Worked on o_ntext_mirror 

	Worked on o_complex_mirror

	Added all o_*_mirror_world

	Found/fixed a minor bug in the text rotate dealing with the mirror of
	attributes (mirroring wrong point when mirroring attributes)

	Discovered a case which broke arc printing (negative sweep angles),
	Hacked something together to fix it, but unknown if it's a complete
	solution

	Figured out how to finish up complex mirrors, but that will have
	to wait till tomorrow.

10/4/98 Worked on gettting printing working and flexible (f_print)

	Got text to be printed using native postscript fonts.  The mapping
	between the stroked fonts and the real ones is really close, not 
	perfect, but close.

10/1/98 Fixed all warnings (with -Wall)

	Found a place where temp_parent wasn't being used to temporarly
	hold object_parent (o_list.c _copy_all)

	Added README and COPYING

9/30/98	Added code to have text that is rotate 180 degrees be upright and
	readable (almost perfect, but still need to get it exactly looking
	right) (text with bars and text with subscripts doesn't rotate right,
	but that can be fixed in a better way)

9/29/98 Today starts the new release system: 19980929

	Added o_attrib_copy_all (to copy attribute lists), useful when you 
	rotate components (and the attribute list is discarded)

	Added o_attrib_reattach and o_attrib_set_color to help support the
	proper continuation of attached attributes to complexes when they 
	are rotated

0.0.5
-------
9/27/98 Fixed o_complex_*_rotate functions to actually work
	Modelled after the ntext ones

	Found a rotate bug in arc_world if you passed in a zero angle
	Made a similar change to all the rotate_world functions

	Found a new bug in arc_rotate_world, arc's were not being rotated
	correctly

	Moved the highly gschem specific o_complex_rotate into gschem/

	Fixed the broken x_update_log call in s_log_message

9/26/98 Added o_*_rotate_world routines  

	More attempts at getting complex's to read and rotate in correctly

	Added o_ntext_rotate_lowlevel (which properly rotates text 
	based on angle)

	Fixed rotate_point_90 so that it can accept any angle in increments
	of 90 degrees.

	Wrote and Got o_ntext_rotate working (which rotates text when you
	hit the rotate button)

9/25/98 Added the angle argument to the complex type (this breaks all 
	schematic files!!) (embedded components now totally broken)

9/23/98	Fixed snap_grid, so that it would work on negative inputs (doh!)

	Added rotate_point_90, a simplied more general func of rotate_point
	Might be removed in the future, but for now is guaranteed to work.

	Fixed o_line_rotate (better name) and to use above function

	Added all the o_*_rotate functions, most stubbed, only ones that work
	are the line related ones

9/17/98 New code for snapping to the grid (m_basic.c)

9/13/98	Added scheme_directory to the TOPLEVEL structure 

9/12/98 Added return_zoom_number (m_basic.c)

	Added world_get_complex_bounds (o_complex_basic.c)

	Added o_complex_world_translate_toplevel (for object like components)
	which should be completely translated (o_complex_basic.c)

	Added world_get_ntext_bounds (o_ntext_basic.c)

	Fixed a bug in o_ntext_add where the bounding box of the text item
	was not being set (incorrect call to get_ntext_bounds)

	Fixed a bug in the translate_all deal with complex objects, wrong
	complex translate was being called (should have been _toplevel)

9/4/98	Switched to -version-info since it's more portable 
	
	Moved o_basic (mostly) out of libgeda and into gschem

	Removed a lot of gschem specific functions out of libgeda

	Made some function pointers so that various functions can be 
	revectored (very useful) 

9/3/98	Create libgeda using libtool

	Forced library name to use -release instead of -version-info
	because library will change drastically for a while

	Started work on breaking (removing specifics) libgeda from gschem
