Graph manager

Graph manager is used for defining presentation of simulation results. Because
of this it is always related to a simulation file. Graph file never contains 
data, they are loaded from the reffered results file which has exactly the 
same name as simulation file.

Graph manager should support many kind of graph tools. Not all function can 
be used with any tool. Graph parameters not allowed should be not editable 
but saved in any case with default values. If a user enter them in context
of one tool then switch to another one not supporting them - they will be
saved but not used.

Graph manager can be started in different ways:

graphman -f <graph file> -o - opens a window for editting graph properties

graphman -f <graph file> -g – generates a graph viewer file(s) pointed out in
graph file without displaying any window

graphman -f <graph file> -e <exported file> -m <filter_name> – exports a graph
(without -m the same as -g)

/* --- planned modes ---
graphman -f <graph file> - opens a window and displays a graph following view
definition in a graph file and data contained in a reffered results file.
graphman -f <graph file> -d – displays a graph
graphman -f <graph file> -i <imported file> -m <filter_name> – imports a graph
graphman -f <graph file> -c – creates a new empty graph
Additional switch '-p <pid number>' can be added in any case. This switch
causes integration with running GManager instance which pid is pointed out. 

Graph file

Filename convention

Files can have any name, even including spaces, national characters and others
that OS can support. Simulation manager may not limit them. Mandatory extension
for the file is *.gph.

Format description

Format of the files are as follows:

* all lines should be ended with \n (x10),
* line beginning with # or a blank character are ignored,
* all parameters are saved in a form of:
  PARAMETER ARGUMENT = VALUE1, VALUE2, VALUE3, ...
  number of values are not limitted but at least one should be defined,
  string values are in “”,
  ARGUMENT is not mandatory but can appear.
* all parameters appear in sections marked by a line:
  [<Section_name>]
  where <Section_name> can be one of [MAIN | XAXIS | YAXIS]
