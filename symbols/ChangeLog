9/13/99	Fixed all the misc power/gnd symbols to work with the new net= 
	gnetlist options
		- Removed all special attributes
		- Properly named pin# attributes
		- Added net=GND:1 to gnd-1.sym 
		- Did not add any net= attribs to any v* symbol
		- Made sure all the v*-1.sym are consistant

	Removed vdd-1.sym and renamed vdd-2.sym to be vdd-1.sym 
	(old vdd-1.sym was just a 180 degree rotation of vdd-2)
	All v symbols should be drawn with the label on top, and the 
	pin going down.  All gnd symbols should have the pin going up.

	Created misc/vee-1.sym

	Created symbol directory called titleblock.  Moved all the title block
	symbols into this new library.
