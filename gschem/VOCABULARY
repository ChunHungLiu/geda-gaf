SHEET  		A schematic sheet, this is what you see in a gschem window

PAGE		Same as SHEET

SCHEMATIC	Just another name for SHEET

BUFFER		A more generic term for a SHEET/PAGE/SCHEMATIC (like an emacs
		buffer)

SYMBOL 		A representation of a schematic SHEET 

EMBEDDED
SYMBOL 
(COMPONENT)	A component which is part of a SCHEMATIC SHEET.  If a user
	 	embeds a component then that component becomes part of the
		SHEET and the schematic no longer depends on the original
		component .sym file.  This makes the sharing of schematic
		sheets easier.

PRIMITIVE 	A SYMBOL that is part of a LIBRARY

LIBRARY 	Collection of PRIMITIVES - gates, hdl or spice models.

PROJECT 	Whole collection of SHEETS, LAYOUTS, MODELS, documentation 
		etc...

DESIGN		A very confusing word and should not be used since it means
		very different things to different people.

NET 		Connects two or more pins in a sheet- is made of one or more
   		SEGMENTS ( a symbolic representation of a wire )

SEGMENT		Part of a NET - has two endings only

LINE		Used in drawing symbols, has no electrical significance

MODEL		A description of how the device behaves.  Used in simulations.
		Can use a HDL or some other representation.

HDL		Hardware Description Language, used to simulate/document
		a device.

SOURCE		Either a SCHEMATIC (SHEET), HDL code, or MODEL which 
		implements, describes, or documents some aspect of the PROJECT

PUSH		The action of going inside a SYMBOL to see the underlying 
		SHEET or MODEL

POP		The action of coming out of a SYMBOL (opposite of PUSH).

HIERARCHICAL 	The concept that SYMBOLS can represent (or abstract) SHEETS.

SERIES		A collection of SHEETS/SYMBOLS which share a common basename
		(series_1.sch series_2.sch series_3.sch etc...)  A series 
		basename ties SHEETS/SYMBOLS together

ATTRIBUTE	?	
BUS		?
LAYOUT		?
RATS NEST	?

FOOTPRINT - the PCB glyph for a device (?)
TRACK - PCB equiv of a net, end to end sense
TRACK SEGMENT - line making up a track
CORNER - junctions of track segments
LAYER - should this be a physical thing or can many
       logical layers appear in a single physical layer
       (like the nice layer groups in pcb and in the nascent
       gPCB).
VIA - a connection from one layer to another through a board
PAD - a single connection PCB symbol thingy, part of a
       FOOTPRINT.
