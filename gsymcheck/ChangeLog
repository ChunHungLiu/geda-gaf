Most recent changes (version wise) are at the top of this file 

1999-10-03  Ales Hvezda  <ahvezda@geda.seul.org>

	* In all *.c included define.h before struct.h 

9/19/99 Make sure gsymcheck runs with guile-1.3.2a

	Fixed all warnings

9/16/99	Added code in gsymcheck.c to only load up schematics which haven't
        been loaded already

9/4/99	Finally integrated gsymcheck into the new development snapshot
	scheme

	Created basic gsymcheck.1 manpage

	Started to do minor updates to the code 

---------------- Development division starts here --------------------------

3/19/99 Updated g_rc to print more diag message to the log file when
        it can't find an rc file (like gschem)

3/18/99 Updated g_rc to use new macros for finding system-*rc files

3/9/99  Fixed a few variables which were uninitialized (width, height,
	snap_size)

3/1/99  Added missing tube and radio paths from *rc file

2/25/99 Added s_symstruct.c to init and manage the per symbol struct 

	Rewrote the way errors are reported and handled (now error messages
	are printed and checked for after all the checking work is done)

1/30/99 Added -c flag (and associated global variable, check_mode)

	Added s_check.c : s_check_all and s_check_symbol

	Worked on above to get the most basic attribute checks 
	
	Changed some quiet_mode ifs to be verbose_mode ifs
	
	Renamed gsymbol to gsymcheck.  

	Removed -c flag, since now that's the only purpose of the program

1/27/99 Took gnetlist source and converted to look like gsymbol.

	Got source to compile and load in schematic/symbol files

1/9/99 	Cleaned up some character strings to reflect that this is gsymbol
	not gnetlist
