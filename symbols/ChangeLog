9/15/99	Added pin#= attributes to all symbols in the io library

	Added device= attributes to all the symbols in the io library

9/13/99	Fixed all the misc power/gnd symbols to work with the new net= 
	gnetlist options
		- Removed all special attributes
		- Properly named pin# attributes
		- Added net=GND:1 to gnd-1.sym 
		- Did not add any net= attribs to any v* symbol
		- Made sure all the v*-1.sym are consistant

	Removed vdd-1.sym and renamed vdd-2.sym to be vdd-1.sym 
	(old vdd-1.sym was just a 180 degree rotation of vdd-2)
	All v symbols should be drawn with the label on top, and the 
	pin going down.  All gnd symbols should have the pin going up.

9/6/99	Start of getting symbols updated with the new colors scheme:
		- All locked components need to be color 15 (locked)
		- All text items need to be color 9
	
	Did all title blocks (updated locked color to 15)

	a core dump (now fixed) by having improper/incomplete attributes

	Removed 74174-1.sym since it is wrong (wrong number of pins)

	Did all symbols which had text (updated text color to 9)

8/27/99 Set the program version to 19990829 to force Ales to release
        on the 29th :)

8/8/99	Renamed some of the verilog symbols to be named *-1.sym

8/3/99	Added a whole bunch of verilog symbols by Mike Jarabek

7/5/99 	Removed numslots=1 from switch-dip[4|8]-1.sym (isn't needed)

7/4/99	Added update/new symbols for verilog netlist from Mike Jarabek

7/3/99	Went through all symbols and eliminated all zero length objects
	(using the new warning code in libgeda)
