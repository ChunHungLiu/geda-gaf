    gattrib: Fix crash when removing attributes from multiple files.
    
    We were iterating over a list which could have objects removed from it.
    Since this is dangerous, iterate over a copy of the list. Since
    attributes come later in the object list than the objects they are
    attached to, iterating the list backwards means we don't
    encounter objects we've already free'd.
    
    We also need to set TOPLEVEL->page_current to the page we're working on,
    since within the loop, this variable is used to find which linked list
    to remove the objects from.

    The sheet is read-only, since there is no way to change pin attributes
    on the schematic. (And gattrib refuses to load symbol files).

    Adjust MINGW32 specific CFLAGS from the suite
    
    Console applications should not build with the -mwindows flag, otherwise
    output reach the console. Conversely, we should build the GUI apps, gschem
    and gattrib with -mwindows so they don't bring up a console window when
    running.

    Use the SHELL variable to locate a shell for icon-theme-installer
    
    /bin/sh on some systems like SunOS (solaris) is too broken but in those
    cases SHELL is typically set to a functioning shell like /bin/ksh.  This
    repairs the install on "shell challenged" systems.

    gattrib: Don't special-case ignore components with "graphical" attribute.
    
    It was noted that special-casing the "graphical" attribute could cause
    gattrib to crash on save (Bug #2214739).
    
    There is no real reason why the user might not want to edit a graphical
    symol's attributes with gattrib, so we should treat it like any other.

    and skip whatever we were doing if this is encountered.

    gattrib, gschlas: Restore setting dummy select_func to ensure proper save
    
    The select_func function pointer (now owned and exported by libgeda) is
    assigned to OBJECT->sel_func for non-locked objects. Locking is achieved
    by setting OBJECT->sel_func to NULL, and when writing out objects, the
    locked flag is determined by comparing that that pointer to NULL.
    
    We need to keep providing a dummy function so we can differentiate
    between that and a NULL pointer. This was accidentally lost in
    commit 1aab94354f053887db67aa5702abc595795dfe82 which moved the
    select_func global variable into libgeda.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    Use pkg-config support for Guile if present.
    
    Using pkg-config allows easier cross-compilation, since the build
    process can use a pkg-config binary native to the build machine with .pc
    files for the host machine.

    gattrib: Fix more non-literal format strings which cause compiler warnings.
    
    We should be careful to avoid passing arbitrary strings into functions
    which take printf style arguments. In that case, always use the construct
    ("%s", string) rather than passing string as the format argument.
    
    Admittedly, some of the cases fixed were fine anyway, as the string passed
    was a known constant. In any case, less noise from the compiler leads to
    easier spotting of real problems.

    Allows cleaner use of objects where we might want to insert the object
    into a GList rather than a self-linked list of OBJECTs.

    Revert commit #17cd47a31a4b84d02726391f980ae493d927809b

          Use o_attrib_get_name_value() to parse attribute strings in gattrib.
    
          Replaced u_basic_breakup_string() with o_attrib_get_name_value() in
          gattrib when splitting attribute string for name and/or value.
    
    This commit introduced a crash saving certain schematics.
    
    It appears to be caused because gattrib uses invalid attribute strings
    such as "attrib_name=" to mark objects which do not have a particular
    attribute present (or that it was deleted during editing).
    
    Since o_attrib_get_name_value() can only processes valid attribute
    strings, it is useless for parsing strings such as these.
    
    Since it isn't immediately clear how many of the o_attrib_get_name_value()
    calls introduced in the above commit are affected by this
    (specifically, where in gattrib these invalid strings are encountered),
    I'm reverting the whole patch rather than trying to build a fix on top.

    libgeda: Tidy o_attrib_attach() harder
    
    Remove searching in parent_list for the attribute we're about to attach.
    This check isn't needed, we were passed the attribute as an argument.
    Let the caller be responsible for making sure it is linked into the
    appropriate object list.

    gattrib: Fix s_attrib_name_in_list() to avoid critical warning and leak
    
    A NULL string should not be passed to o_attrib_get_name_value(), as this
    now causes a critical level warning. Skip over NULL list items.
    
    Free memory allocated by o_attrib_get_name_value().

    gattrib: Attempt to make sheet changed detection less sensitive. (CODE!*)
    
    * Really now.. this is getting embarassing.
    
    The old code set the page's CHANGED flag upon received keypresses,
    including modifier-keys such as Alt etc.. (As used to access the
    common Alt+F4 shortcut to close the window), meaning the user was
    always prompted that they would loose changes.
    
    Remove setting the CHANGED flag in functions gtk_entry_enter_text
    and gtk_sheet_key_press. Instead, set it in gtk_sheet_entry_changed
    and gtk_sheet_real_cell_clear.
    
    This code could do with some closer attention in the future. There
    are certainly more appropriate places to set the CHANGED flag,
    ie. without hacking the gtksheet implementation to do it directly.

    Draw func cleanup.
    
    Rather than having libgeda require other applications to provide the

    Updated version to 1.5.0 to mark the start of the next development cycle

commit 5757ce41ac1846814b0e96885942f2e011f2d3b7

    Rename translations to drop un-needed ISO-3166 country codes.
    
    From Debian bug #336796:
    
    Using a country part in a translation file is a discouraged practice
    except in very few cases (such as pt_BR).
    
    Using a fr_FR.po file instead of a fr.po file prevents users of fr_CA,
    fr_BE, fr_LU, fr_CH and all other existing and future locales for
    French to benefit from the French translation of the program.
    
    In general PO files should only be named after the
    ISO_639 code of the given language and should not use a country part
    with a ISO-3166 code. The only accepted expcetions to this are:
    
    -pt_BR for Brazilian Portuguese and pt alone for "standard Portuguese"
    -zh_CN for "Simplified Chinese" use in mailand China and Singapore
    -zh_TW for "Traditional Chinese" used in Taiwan

    Added the use of GEDADATA environment variable to make gattrib relocatable
    
    gattrib was hardcoding the path to gattrib-menus.xml (using GEDADATADIR
    which is set at configure time).  This patch makes it possible to move
    the gattrib binary to a different prefix.  If GEDADATA is not set, then
    the original behavior of using GEDADATADIR to find gattrib-menus.xml is
    used.

    When a "gattrib" icon is found in the icon theme, this will be used as the
    default application icon. For GTK versions < 2.6, some default sizes have
    been picked at which to look for icons. GTK >= 2.6 will find the best icon
    by name.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Fixed a whole bunch of gtk+ 2.4.x and misc issues building on an older box
    
    This is a fix for (Patch#) 1789290 libgeda-1.2.0 fprintf which supplied a
    similar patch which fixes the issues in libgeda/src/s_clib.c and
    libgeda/src/s_textbuffer.c.  In the future, all releases will be built with
    gtk+ 2.4.x so that these sorts of problems do not get released.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    move menu callbacks to x_window.c
    
    This patch moves all menu callbacks to x_window.c, where
    they belong. The x_window_init() function is cleaned up.
    Selecting File->Open now causes the "unimplemented feature"
    dialog to pop up.

    Changed configure.ac(.in) to allow guile-1.6
    
    Introduces compatibility #defines where guile 1.8 funcs are missing in
    guile 1.6. Also adds missing configure.ac checks for guile in packages

    Change selection code to use a generic GedaList typecast to SELECTION.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    Added call to g_thread_init() in Gschem and Gattrib.
    
    Gschem and Gattrib aren't threaded, but some of GTK's file chooser
    backends uses threading so we need to call g_thread_init().
